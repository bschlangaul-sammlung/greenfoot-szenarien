You play this game as Luigi, Mario or the Blue Toad! If you’re familiar with Mario games, you fit right in! If not, here’s the basics.
When you are small and you get hit, you lose a life. Collecting a red mushroom will transform you into your super form. If the super form gets hit it returns to small Luigi. When either form get a fire flower, they are transformed into fire form. Fire balls destroy any enemy, except Bowser and Bowser jr. Collecting a green mushroom will give you an extra life.
